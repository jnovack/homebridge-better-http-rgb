**2020-06 Update:** *Please note, this project is archived and no longer being maintained.  I no longer use Homebridge.  There are a number of forks which may provide you a better more up-to-date experience.  Two of which I have found with significant improvements are listed below.*

----

Supports RGB http(s) devices on the HomeBridge Platform and provides a readable
callback for getting and setting the following characteristics to Homekit:

* Characteristic.On
* Characteristic.Brightness
* Characteristic.Hue
* Characteristic.Saturation

# Installation

1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2. Install homebridge-http using: `npm install -g homebridge-better-http-rgb`
3. Update your configuration file.  See below for examples.


# Configuration

## Structure

The following is an overview of the structure of your HTTP-RGB accessory.

Both `powerOn` and `powerOff` can either be a `string` or an `object`.  If a
`string` is provided it is filled in as the `url` and the `body` will be blank.
Most devices will be ok with the `string` option.

The purpose of `powerOff`/`powerOn` for an RGB light is not to physically power
or de-power the device (as then how would it respond to further commands?), but
to set the LED color to black (for `powerOff`), and restore the color (for
`powerOn`).  Your backend device should already be doing this.  This is just
a convenience function so that your HomeBridge knows this device can turn off
or on.

Additionally, both `brightness` and `color` share the same structure (with the
exception that the `color` structure allows for a `.brightness` variable), they
can either be a `string` or an `object`.  If it is a `string`, it is filled in
as the `status` and the other fields are left blank. When this is the case, you
can only read the settings, you may not change them.

`service` is one of `['Light', 'Switch']`.

## Examples

### Full RGB Device

        {
            "accessory": "HTTP-RGB",
            "name": "RGB Led Strip",
            "service": "Light",

                "url": "http://localhost/api/v1/brightness/%s"
            },

            "color": {
                "status": "http://localhost/api/v1/set",
                "url": "http://localhost/api/v1/set/%s",
                "brightness": true
            }
        }
    ]

### Single Color Light that only turns "off" and "on"

    "accessories": [
        {
            "accessory": "HTTP-RGB",
            "name": "Single Color Light",
            "service": "Light",

            "switch": {
                "status": "http://localhost/api/v1/status",
                "powerOn": "http://localhost/api/v1/on",
                "powerOff": "http://localhost/api/v1/off"
            }
        }
    ]

### Single Color Light with Brightness

    "accessories": [
        {
            "accessory": "HTTP-RGB",
            "name": "Single Color Light",
            "service": "Light",

            "switch": {
                "status": "http://localhost/api/v1/status",
                "powerOn": "http://localhost/api/v1/on",
                "powerOff": "http://localhost/api/v1/off"
            },

            "brightness": {
                "status": "http://localhost/api/v1/brightness",
                "url": "http://localhost/api/v1/brightness/%s"
            }
        }
    ]

### RGB Light without Brightness

    "accessories": [
        {
            "accessory": "HTTP-RGB",
            "name": "Single Color Light",
            "service": "Light",

            "switch": {
                "status": "http://localhost/api/v1/status",
                "powerOn": "http://localhost/api/v1/on",
                "powerOff": "http://localhost/api/v1/off"
            },

            "color": {
                "status": "http://localhost/api/v1/set",
                "url": "http://localhost/api/v1/set/%s"
            }
        }
    ]

This normally will not occur, however, you may not want your application to
display a "brightness" slider to the user.  In this case, you will want to
remove the brightness component from the config.


# Interfacing

All the `.status` urls expect a 200 HTTP status code and a body of a single
string with no HTML markup.

* `switch.status` expects `0` for Off, and `1` for On.
* `brightness.status` expects a number from 0 to 100.
* `color.status` expects a 6-digit hexidemial number.

## http-led-controller

This package was developed in tandem with
[jnovack/http-led-controller](https://github.com/jnovack/http-led-controller).

I needed a way to control my [blinksticks](https://www.blinkstick.com/) from
HomeKit/HomeBridge.  After developing this package, I had to have a backend in
the event someone's HomeKit/HomeBridge is on a different server, or in my case,
there are 4-5 different Raspberry Pi's running blinksticks around my house.


# Why 'better'?

As we all know, the word 'better' is subjective, so why put it in the title? I
decided to call it 'better' because it is intended to be a 'better' example of
how to code, not in the way of a 'better' or more feature-rich project.

There's thousands of projects on github that are just thrown together, half-
working, or abandoned and I wanted to make sure that my little contribution to
the open-source movement gave more than just code.

The 'better'-project goals are to make sure there is documentation, tests, code
and style standards. While I may have missed a few spots, my intention is to
ensure that those exist.  There is value in documentation, style and testing;
and I want to serve as an example to younger (or newer) coders that may be
trying to hack apart this project.


# TODO

* Perhaps validation of some sort?
* _httprequest should check for non-200
* Better error handling of config errors
